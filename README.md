# TheatreSeating
A simple java program for theatre seat allocation. 

This program will process the pre-sale ticket requests.

Initially we parse a theatre layout and the list of ticket requests and produce a list of tickets or explanations in the same order
as the requests.

The theater layout is made up of 1 or more rows.
Each row is made up of 1 or more sections separated by a space.

After the theater layout, there is one empty line, followed by 1 or more theater requests.
The theater request is made up of a name followed by a space and the number of requested tickets.
